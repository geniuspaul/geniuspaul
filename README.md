## Hi, I'm Usakahyel Paul

I'm a student at Nigerian Army University pursuing a BSc in Computer Science. Passionate about problem-solving and innovation, I have 3 years of experience specializing in Python, basic Java, Django, AWS, and SQL. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy contributing to projects that make a positive impact. 

Outside of work, I enjoy going to the gym, thinking, and listening to music. Let's connect and explore opportunities together!
